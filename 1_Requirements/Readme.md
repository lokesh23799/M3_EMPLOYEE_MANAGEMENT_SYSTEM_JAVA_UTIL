# High Level Requirements:

| ID | Description | Category |	Status |
| ---- | ------------------- | ----- | ---- |
| HR01 | cilent shall be able to add Employee record | Techincal	| TBD-S1 |
| HR02 | cilent shall be able to display Employee record | Techincal | TBD-S1 |
| HR03 | cilent shall be able to update a Employee record	| Techincal |	TBD-S1 |
| HR04 | cilent shall be able to delete a Employee record	| Techincal |	TBD-S1 |
| HR05 | cilent shall be able to save records in a file |	Techincal	| TBD-S1 |
| HR06 | cilent shall be able to read data from a file | Techincal | TBD-S1 |
| HR07 | Data should not be lost in case of faliure |	Scenario | FUTURE |
| HR08 | Data should be stored when closing the system | Scenario | TBD-S1 |

## Low level Requirements:

| ID | Description |	HLR ID |	Status (Implemented/Future) |
| ---- | -------------- | ---- | ----- |
| LR01 |	New record is added and Employee id should be unique | HR01 | TBD-S1 |
| LR02 |	Finding the Employee details can be either by searching by name or the best way of searching is by Employee id | HR02 |	TBD-S1 |
| LR03 |	If user searches for an invalid ID ""ERROR RECORD NOT FOUND" message should be displayed | HR02 |	TBD-S1 |
| LR04 |	User need to search by the Employee id for the details to be updated, if no record is available then "ERROR RECORD NOT FOUND" Message should be displayed |	HR02 |	TBD-S1 |
| LR06 |	User need to search by id for the Employee record to be deleted, if no such record is available then "ERROR RECORD NOT FOUND" Message should be displayed |	HR04 |	TBD-S1 |
| LR05 |	User shall be able to save the files, if file already exists then it should append to file and should not overwrite it and if file does not exists then it should create a new file |	HR06 | TBD-S1 |
| LR06 |	If opening the login page fails system shloud prompt the message "Invalid login" |	HR07 | TBD-S1 |
| LR07 |	After adding each record it asks whether you need to add an another record or Not and Display message as "Y/N" if want to add/modify/delete another record can click Y/N	 | HR01,HR02,HR03,HR04 | TBD-S1 |

## Best Methods To Be Followed

* Used functions to decrease dependency on main function
* Used structures and arrays to accept the inputs from user and store the values which helped in creating easy design of Employee management system.
* Printf statements have been placed only wherever necessary to avoid confusions
* Created header file so that the fuctions can be used else where ever required without any difficulty
* Unit testing is done to avoid any computational errors.
